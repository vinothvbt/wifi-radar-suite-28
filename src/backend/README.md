**"Permission denied" errors**
```bash
# Run with root privileges
sudo python3 main_launcher.py
```

**Missing dependencies**
```bash
# Install all required packages
sudo apt install python3-pyqt5 python3-pyqt5-dev wireless-tools iw
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Interface busy/scanning fails**
```bash
# Stop NetworkManager temporarily
sudo systemctl stop NetworkManager
sudo systemctl stop wpa_supplicant

# Run the application
sudo python3 main_launcher.py

# Restart NetworkManager after use
sudo systemctl start NetworkManager
```

**TypeError in radar visualization**
- This has been fixed in the modern version by converting float values to integers in drawEllipse calls
